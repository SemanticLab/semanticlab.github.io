title: "Alpha version of IMLS-Funded DADAlytics Sélavy tool released"
---
The Semantic Lab has launched our alpha version of Sélavy, an application in development by Prof. Matt Miller as part of the [IMLS-funded project DADAlytics](https://semlab.io/projects/). This is an early version of the Sélavy tool, which processes text-based documents and exports them as triples. Watch our [demo video](https://semlab.io/howto/selavy_alpha) and [start processing a new document using Sélavy](http://159.89.242.202:3000/).
