title: "Testing of the IMLS-Funded DADAlytics NER Toolchain"
---


The Semantic Lab is currently testing the [IMLS-Funded DADAlytics NER Toolchain](http://semlab.io/DADAlytics_ner_demo/) on a corpus of documents provided by the project stakeholders and partners. Entities automatically extracted via DADAlytics will be compared to entities manually marked-up by Semantic Lab students. The results of the testing will be available soon from the [project page](https://semlab.io/projects/).
