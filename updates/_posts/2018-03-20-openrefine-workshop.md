This event will be held Wednesday, March 28, 2018 from 3 - 6pm at the Pratt Manhattan Campus, Room 613. OpenRefine is a popular data wrangling tool for data cleaning and transformation and has become key for creating interoperable linked data. The workshop is designed to serve all levels of practitioners interested in adding linked data to their records or creating linked data. Participants will have the opportunity to complete a cleaning and reconciliation workflow using *OpenRefine*. With a focus on art-related data, this workshop covers:
* Data-cleaning with *OpenRefine*
* Entity reconciliation using VIAF and Wikidata with *OpenRefine*
* Discussion of metadata enrichment with linked open data
