The Semantic Lab is excited to introduce a new tool under development â€” the [Triple Builder](http://tb.semlab.io/). Created by Professor Matt Miller, this tool makes it easy to create and share RDF triples and knowledge graphs.  Learn more about the Triple Builder [here](https://medium.com/@thisismattmiller/triple-builder-subsets-28152364b587) or test it at [tb.semlab.io](http://tb.semlab.io/).
