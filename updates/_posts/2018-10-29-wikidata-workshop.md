The Semantic Lab at Pratt, in collaboration with [Wikimedia NYC](https://nyc.wikimedia.org/wiki/Home), presents the first workshop of a Wikidata workshop series on Saturday, November 10 from 10:00am - 1:00pm, open to all current Pratt School of Information students. [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) is a collaboratively edited knowledge base hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, which serves as a common source of data for Wikimedia and linked data projects. Pratt Alum [Megan Wacha](https://twitter.com/megwacha), Scholarly Communications Librarian at the City University of New York's Office of Library Services and current president of WikimediaNYC, will lead the workshop.
