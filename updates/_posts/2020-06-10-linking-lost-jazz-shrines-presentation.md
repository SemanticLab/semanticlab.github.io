Semantic Lab Co-director Cristina Pattuelli and Research Fellow Sarah Ann Adams participated in [a panel discussion organized by the Weeksville Heritage Center](https://www.weeksvillesociety.org/weeksville-wednesdays/2020/6/10/preserving-of-brooklyns-jazz-legacy-linking-lost-jazz-shrines-panel-cww9j), with archivist Zakiya Collier, DC Jazz Festival artistic director Willard Jenkins, and Jazz Historian Basir Mchawi, on June 10, 2020. They discussed the important connections between jazz figures and architects from Central Brooklyn with the larger canvas of jazz history, in the context of the [Linking Lost Jazz Shrines project](https://semlab.io/projects/#linking-lost-jazz-shrines), which is a collaboration between Weeksville and Prattâ€™s Semantic Lab.
