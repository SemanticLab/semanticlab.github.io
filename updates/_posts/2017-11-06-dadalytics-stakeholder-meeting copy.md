title: "DADAlytics Stakeholder Meeting"
---


We held our DADAlytics IMLS grant Stakeholder Meeting today. 

The primary goal of the meeting is to begin to identify the general and technical user requirements of the DADAlytics system to maximize its usability, flexibility and scalability. We hope to gain insight from the participants unique perspective's on professional practices, collection processing workflows and end user/research needs. Based on sample documents provided by each of the stakeholder participants, we will draft a plan to develop a corpus of documents for the project testbed.

We will be releasing a summery and minuets from this meeting in the coming weeks.
