[Linked Data Liminality](https://www.vala.org.au/keynote-speaker2018)


Link Data has been on the metadata horizon for libraries and other cultural heritage institutions for some time. While great progress has been made we are still in the early days of adopting and applying these new methodologies. Though we often think of Linked Data as a universal big data endeavor, being worked on by large entities, some of its most compelling uses are small
scale bottom-up projects. For example, using Linked Data to uncover underrepresented
individuals and their histories. Or utilizing it as a pedagogical platform to build new skills for
current and emerging information professionals. And even thinking of Linked Data as a tool for
increasing civic engagement. We&#39;ll explore projects like these and think broadly how Linked
Data can used in exciting ways. We will also reflect on what we can rethink during this period of
transition. Data models, workflows, how we collaborate and more can be looked at with a critical
eye. While Linked Data presents significant challenges it also creates important new
opportunities for change and growth.
