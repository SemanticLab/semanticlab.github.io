title: "Zena Latto: Linking From the Margins"
---

After working with [Carnegie Hall](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Blog/2016/09/Zenas-Flyer) to uncover jazz musician Zena Latto's story, the Semantic Lab at Pratt is now returning to the subject with the intent of finding links to other marginalized women in jazz through the Zena Latto archival material. In collaboration with the student organization [ASIS&T @ Pratt](https://pratt.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/asist), Semantic Lab members will bring in examples of these materials to share, and discuss this project as part of a larger dialogue about the use of linked open data to bring buried information and individuals to light. This event will be held at Pratt School of Information on Wednesday, February 6th from 5:55 - 6:25. For more information, please visit the Semantic Lab [projects page](https://semlab.io/projects/#zena-latto-project).
