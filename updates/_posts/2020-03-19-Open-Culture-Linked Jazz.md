Open Culture featured the Linked Jazz project in [an article](http://www.openculture.com/2020/03/linked-jazz.html) titled "Linked Jazz: A Huge Data Visualization Maps the Relationship Between Countless Jazz Musicians & Restores Forgotten Women to Jazz History." The piece calls Linked Jazz "one of the best music data visualizations I've seen," saying it "accounts seamlessly for what appears to be the whole of jazz, including obscure and forgotten figures."
