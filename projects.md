**DADAlytics IMLS Grant**

The School of Information at Pratt Institute will develop a prototype of DADAlytics, a modular tool that performs supervised entity extraction from archival documents for generating linked open datasets, lowering barriers to entry for institutions seeking to create linked open data from archival materials. This project will build on previous work to develop the Linked Jazz Transcript Analyzer, extending that tool's functionality and making it more widely available for use by other institutions. Grant funds will support the research and data gathering needed to inform the redesign and reengineering of the tool, including an environmental scan, a series of meetings with key stakeholders and the development of a prototype.

**Linked Jazz**

Linked Jazz is a research project investigating the application of Linked Open Data technologies to digital cultural heritage materials. Our goals are:

* To uncover meaningful connections between documents and data related to the personal and professional lives of jazz artists, and
* To develop broadly applicable tools and methods for working with Linked Open Data.

The project draws on jazz history materials in digital format to expose relationships between musicians and reveal their community network. New modes of connecting cultural data have the potential to open up new and unprecedented avenues of research and community engagement.
