# DADAlytics
We envision DADAlytics to be a modular tool that performs supervised entity extraction from archival documents for generating linked open datasets, lowering barriers to entry for institutions seeking to create linked open data from archival materials. This project will build on previous work to develop the Linked Jazz Transcript Analyzer, extending that tool's functionality and making it more widely available for use by other institutions. Grant funds will support the research and data gathering needed to inform the redesign and reengineering of the tool, including an environmental scan, a series of meetings with key stakeholders and the development of a prototype.

# [Linked Jazz](https://linkedjazz.org/)
Linked Jazz is a research project investigating the application of Linked Open Data technologies to digital cultural heritage materials. Our goals are:

+ To uncover meaningful connections between documents and data related to the personal and professional lives of jazz artists, and
+ To develop broadly applicable tools and methods for working with Linked Open Data.

The project draws on jazz history materials in digital format to expose relationships between musicians and reveal their community network. New modes of connecting cultural data have the potential to open up new and unprecedented avenues of research and community engagement. At the heart of our work are oral histories of jazz musicians. We are currently expanding our data sources to include other document types and music-related datasets.

# [The Drawings of the Florentine Painters](https://florentinedrawings.itatti.harvard.edu/)
### by Bernard Berenson
Bernard Berenson’s Drawings of the Florentine Painters is a digital resource based on Berenson’s publication of the same name. This research tool permits searches for any of the drawings listed in the three editions (1903, 1938 in English; 1961, in Italian). Filters allow browsing and searching by artist and title (as provided by Berenson, in English or Italian), location and technique. Each entry includes key information from all three editions of Berenson’s text, as well as the current location, an image of the catalog page, and plates included in 1903 and from the British Museum. Many entries for drawings by Sandro Botticelli and Filippino Lippi (and their schools), have been enriched to include links to museum webpages. This is the first online database to include of a large corpus of Italian Renaissance drawings from different collections.
