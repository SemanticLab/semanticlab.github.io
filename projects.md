Over the course of his five decades-long career Rauschenberg challenged artistic conventions, defied genres and media boundaries, and fostered unconventional collaborations between disparate communities—from dancers and musicians to scientists and engineers. In 1966, with Bell Laboratories engineer Billy Klüver, Rauschenberg founded Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), a seminal initiative to connect art and technology in an impactful way.

This project aims to expose the rich web of relationships surrounding the life and work of the artist Robert Rauschenberg (1926-2008) by leveraging linked data technologies and a dedicated suite of digital tools and applications. We have started with a collection from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation Archives that documents the activity of E. A. T. This collection consists of 141 documents, all recently digitized, that include photos, notebooks, videos, posters, and newspaper clippings.

The jazz community is defined by the relationships that exist between musicians, mentors, rivals, lovers and friends. Exposing these connections and identifying the rich networks they produce is the aim of Linked Jazz. The [Linked Jazz](https://linkedjazz.org/) project investigates the application of Linked Open Data technologies to digitized jazz history materials to uncover meaningful connections between documents and data related to the personal and professional lives of jazz artists.   

The Linked Open Data tools and methods developed for the Linked Jazz project have opened new and unprecedented avenues of research and community engagement. Our work has generated the subprojects listed below.

 - <a name="women-of-jazz"></a>**Women of Jazz** <br/>
The goal of the Linked Jazz knowledge graph is to tell meaningful stories through data. One of the most powerful stories to come out of Linked Jazz was about women in jazz. By viewing connections by gender, it became evident (although not surprising) that a sizable population of outstanding female musicians were not widely known, let alone recognized for their important contributions. [Our findings](https://linkedjazz.org/enriching-the-linked-jazz-name-list-with-gender-information/) led to a series of Women of Jazz Wikipedia Edit-a-thons ([2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/NYC/WomenOfJazz) and [2017)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/New_Orleans/WomenOfJazz) and projects like the creation of a [gender view](https://linkedjazz.org/network/?mode=gender) of the Linked Jazz graph. 

    Our current work to promote the recognition of women in jazz focuses on increasing the representation of these women in knowledge bases used to link information around the web. Starting with specific stories of women jazz musicians as a test case, we are also developing methods to graph out and give visibility to underrepresented communities, weaving their stories into the information landscape.

 - <a name="zena-latto-project"></a>**Zena Latto Project** <br/>
How do you tell the story of someone whose work has left few or no traces? Like so many of the women in jazz, [Zena Latto’s story](https://linkedjazz.org/?p=1230) is representative of musicians whose presence and influence were all but lost to history. Our involvement began when archivists at Carnegie Hall came across a [flyer](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Blog/2016/09/Zenas-Flyer) for a 1957 all-female jazz show they’d hosted but had no institutional record of. The Semantic Lab at Pratt began to gather the materials needed to give Zena an online identity. Prior to her death in 2016, Zena Latto herself consented to an interview and passed her jazz archives on to the Semantic Lab at Pratt. These materials were digitized and made publicly available via the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/LinkedJazzZenaLattoInterview2015). A [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zena_Latto) was created by members of the Semantic Lab, who have [continued to work](https://linkedjazz.org/?p=1230) on the Zena Latto Project. Her record serves as an illustration of the possibilities in historical recovery and a hub for other marginalized women in jazz.

 - <a name="local-496-project"></a>**Local 496 Project** <br/>
The [Local 496 Membership Directory](http://voyager.tcs.tulane.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=531&recCount=10&recPointer=1&bibId=966417) is the official roster of the Local 496 labor union. Created in the 1940s, it includes the names, addresses and instruments of the union members from the one-time segregated African-American chapter of the New Orleans jazz musicians’ union. While the chapter merged with the white musicians’ chapter in 1969, the Directory is a unique document that helps identify a cohesive and interrelated community of musicians. In collaboration with [Tulane University’s Hogan Jazz Archive](https://jazz.tulane.edu/), the Semantic Lab is transforming this static list into an expanded knowledge graph that will support and further jazz and other historical research in significant ways.

 - <a name="linking-lost-jazz-shrines"></a>**Linking Lost Jazz Shrines** <br/>
[Linking Lost Jazz Shrines](https://sites.google.com/weeksvillesociety.org/linking-lost-jazz-shrines) is a [Weeksville Heritage Center](https://www.weeksvillesociety.org/) and Semantic Lab at Pratt collaboration, which seeks to apply linked open data technologies to [The Weeksville Lost Jazz Shrines of Brooklyn (WLJSB)](https://weeksvilleheritagecenter.squarespace.com/s/WLJSB_Finding-Aid_2015.pdf) collection of oral histories. This collection was created as part of a 2008 research project documenting Central Brooklyn’s cultural legacy of jazz history between the 1930s and 1960s. Linking Lost Jazz Shrines will link to the Linked Jazz dataset, as well as contribute new musicians, music groups, and jazz venues, enriching and expanding the Linked Jazz network. In 2020, the LLJS project received the [A.R.T.'s New York Archives Archival Achievement](https://www.nycarchivists.org/event-4004583) award. Funded through an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation’s ["Collections as Data: Part to Whole"](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/) grant program (January 2019-August 2020) and an ["Equity in Action"](https://mnylc.org/equity-in-action/) grant from the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) (February-October 2021).<br/><br/>

With the generous support from IMLS, the Semantic Lab Team has developed a prototype of DADAlytics, a modular tool that performs supervised entity extraction from archival documents for generating linked open datasets, lowering barriers to entry for institutions seeking to create linked open data from archival materials. This project builds on previous work to develop the [Linked Jazz Transcript Analyzer](https://linkedjazz.org/tools/transcript-analyzer/), extending that tool's functionality and making it more widely available for use by other institutions. Grant funds supported the research and data gathering needed to inform the redesign and reengineering of the tool, including an environmental scan, a series of meetings with key stakeholders, and the development of a prototype.

**An Exploratory Study into the Mining and Linking of the Mary Berenson Archive at Villa I Tatti, Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies**

The Mary Berenson Project investigates the application of computational analysis techniques to archival documents to automate the generation of linked open data with the goal of creating networked narratives. Supported by the Pratt School of Information Faculty Innovation Fund and in collaboration with [The Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies, Villa I Tatti](http://itatti.harvard.edu/), the project focuses on the collections of diaries and letters from the Berenson Archives held at the Villa I Tatti.<br/>

[Mary Berenson](http://itatti.harvard.edu/mary-berenson) (Philadelphia, PA 1864-1944 Florence, Italy) was an art historian, critic and wife of Italian Renaissance art historian Bernard Berenson. While she worked in the shadow of her more renowned husband, Mary is now credited with having had significant influence over his scholarly work and having been instrumental in developing the rich social circle of intellectuals, artists and art collectors that surrounded the couple during the years spent at their residence Villa I Tatti in Florence—now The Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies. 

Mary Berenson’s archive, a rich collection of letters, personal diaries, literary journals and notes, both published and unpublished, is part of the Bernard and Mary Berenson Papers (1880-2002) held at the Biblioteca Berenson at the Villa I Tatti. This trove of primary source material has enormous historical value, but has yet to be fully explored.
