**Linked Data per i Beni Culturali, Università di Bologna**

Cristina Pattuelli and Matt Miller

This summer school course at the University of Bologna focuses on the principles and techniques of Linked Data in the context of its relationship to cultural heritage, offering a theoretical and practical introduction to the most recent methods of representing the resources stored in libraries, archives, and other types of cultural institutions. Students gain the skills necessary to process and communicate information about cultural heritage by participating in the construction of the semantic web and the dissemination of knowledge of cultural heritage in a responsible and qualified manner, with the ultimate goal of increasing visibility and facilitating access to these resources.

**Whitney Linked Data Fellowship, Whitney Museum of Art**

Farris Wahbeh - in conjunction with Pratt courses INFO 664 and INFO 698

The purpose of the LOD for Museums Fellowship is to provide support for a MSLIS student to investigate the utilization of Linked Open Data (LOD) within a museum setting. The fellowship allows the student to apply the knowledge and skills acquired from their course work in a professional setting while developing new skills through participation in an on-site internship. Relevant skills that will be developed during the course of the fellowship include data analysis and visualization, metadata research, and semantic web methods. While the project’s goal is to examine the applicability and utilization of LOD resources for a museum’s collections information, the student also learns how information on works of art is administered in a museum setting. Please find below information on the work by current and past recipients of the Whitney Linked Data Fellowship.
