**Linked Open Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums (INFO 670), Pratt Institute**

Cristina Pattuelli

This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Linked Open Data principles, technologies and practices. The full life-cycle from linked data generation to consumption will be addressed, along with concepts of data modeling, RDF vocabularies, dereferenceable URIs, semantic enrichment and linked data publishing and dissemination. Through a series of readings, guest speakers, and projects we will explore the latest linked open data developments in cultural heritage.<br/><br/>

Technical knowledge and proficiency is an increasingly valued and useful skill in a cultural heritage information professional’s skillset. This course will introduce and provide a platform for the building up of these abilities. Over the course of the semester the student will become familiar with programming, working with data in a programmatic manner and applying these skills to build a demonstrable  project. This course will focus on teaching the basics that will enable an information professional to be successful in today’s digital world. [http://pfch.nyc](http://pfch.nyc)

**Linked Data per i Beni Culturali Summer School, University of Bologna**

Cristina Pattuelli and Matt Miller

This summer school course at the University of Bologna focuses on the principles and techniques of Linked Data in the context of its relationship to cultural heritage, offering a theoretical and practical introduction to the most recent methods of representing the resources stored in libraries, archives, and other types of cultural institutions. Students gain the skills necessary to process and communicate information about cultural heritage by participating in the construction of the semantic web and the dissemination of knowledge of cultural heritage in a responsible and qualified manner, with the ultimate goal of increasing visibility and facilitating access to these resources.

**MoMA Linked Open Data Fellowship, Museum of Modern Art Archives**

The purpose of the LOD for Museums Fellowship is to provide support for a student to investigate the application of Linked Open Data (LOD) within a museum setting. The fellowship allows the student to apply the knowledge and competencies acquired from their course work in a professional setting while developing new skills through participation in an on-site internship.  The focus of the fellowship in the MoMA Archives is to help build a multi-institution integrated exhibition history index and explore its expression as linked open data. Relevant skills that will be developed during the course of the fellowship include data analysis, reconciliation methods, archival research methods, and semantic web methods.  The project's ultimate aim is to create a valuable research tool for art historical scholarship while also demonstrating methods for interlinking archival resources online. Please find below information on the work by current and recipients of the MoMA Linked Open Data Fellowship.

**Whitney Linked Data Fellowship, Whitney Museum of Art**

The purpose of the LOD for Museums Fellowship is to provide support for a MSLIS student to investigate the utilization of Linked Open Data (LOD) within a museum setting. The fellowship allows the student to apply the knowledge and skills acquired from their course work in a professional setting while developing new skills through participation in an on-site internship. Relevant skills that will be developed during the course of the fellowship include data analysis and visualization, metadata research, and semantic web methods. While the project’s goal is to examine the applicability and utilization of LOD resources for a museum’s collections information, the student also learns how information on works of art is administered in a museum setting. Please find below information on the work by current and past recipients of the Whitney Linked Data Fellowship.
